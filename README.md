## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information about movies, focusing on their performance metrics and characteristics which include:
- **Date of Release**
- **Language**
- **Type**
- **Title**
- **People Involved**
- **Overall Ratings**
- **Quality Ratings**
- **Repeatability Ratings**

The dataset includes numerous entries, with notable distributions in ratings across languages, as well as trends over time in average quality ratings.

## Insights

Several inferences can be drawn from the dataset profile:
- **Language Influence**: Ratings tend to vary significantly based on the language of the movie. Films in certain languages appear to be rated more favorably.
- **Quality Trends**: There are observable trends in the average quality ratings over time, which may indicate shifts in movie production quality and audience expectations.
- **Repeatability Correlation**: Initial analyses suggest there is no substantial correlation between repeatability scores and overall ratings, hinting that repeat viewing may not be a strong predictor of movie quality.

## Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data integrity and usability:
- **Handling Missing Values**: 
  - The 'by' column had missing entries filled with 'Unknown' to avoid bias in the analysis.
  - For the numeric columns ('overall', 'quality', 'repeatability'), the median was utilized to replace any missing values to mitigate the effect of outliers.
  - The date column utilized a forward-fill method to maintain time series continuity.
  - Columns with more than 50% missing entries, such as the 'by' column when applicable, were dropped from the analysis.

## Types of Analysis

The following analyses were performed to derive insights from the dataset:

1. **Group Analysis**: To explore how the overall rating of movies varies by language.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: To assess the trends of average quality ratings over time, capturing the evolution of movie quality ratings.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: To investigate the relationship between repeatability and overall ratings, determining if one might influence the other.

## Charts
